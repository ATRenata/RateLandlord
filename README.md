# RateLandlord

Deployed in Heroku, this Django app allows one to add a review of their landlord. The website is minimalistic as the primary goal was the backend functionality. 
One can add a landlord, write reviews, and check the landlord's overall rating.  The search is based on the owner's address and not their full name to protect their personal information. Additionally, the system uses Google's Geolocation API to locate the correct homeowner's address. Moreover, Bootstrap alert messages provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions.

Note that the app may take a few moments to launch since Heroku hybernates idle applications.
